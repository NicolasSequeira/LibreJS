2015-10-23 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Converted LibreJS to use jpm instead of the old add-on
	system: cfx. Thanks to Adrian Aichner for helping out
	with this.

2015-10-22 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Add some notes on working with the LibreJS codebase
	to the manual.

2015-10-15 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Revert some commits that were causing problems. Thanks

	Thanks to CY for pointing out that it was missing.

	* Add LibreJS version number in the main addon panel.

	Thanks to Ruben Rodriguez for the patch.

2015-04-02 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Remove the draggable complain banner functionality.
	* Add JsChecker.isFreeLicensed method from Ruben Rodriguez. We're
	hoping this will lead to improved speed and memory usage in LibreJS.

2015-01-17 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Include the Eclipse Public License in license definitions.
	Thanks to Daniel Ziltener for the patch.

	* Fixed a bug that caused the main panel to disappear after
	clicking the red "Whitelist" button on a script that wasn't
	accepted by LibreJS.

2014-12-06 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* You can now specify multiple licenses for a JavaScript file
	that's been compiled or concatenated from more than one source
	file. Info on how to do this is in the manual - search for
	"Specifying multiple licenses". Thanks to Arne Möhle for
	starting a discussion that led to this change.

2014-12-06 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* You can now move the "Complain" button out of the way if it's
	blocking something on the website you're looking at. Thanks to
	Alexandre Garreau for pointing out this problem.

2014-12-01 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Applied a patch from Lutz Horn: updating the whitelisted
	scripts to include some more libraries, and improving the
	gethash.sh script.

2014-11-30 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Add support for using the BSD 3-Clause license in a JavaScript
	Web Labels table. Thanks to Enoch Root for pointing out that this
	wasn't working.
	* Add a "Web Labels pages being used for this session" list on
	the main display panel.

2014-11-20 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Recognize the JS Web Labels link with data-jslicense=1, as
	well as rel="jslicense", in case you want the page to be
	HTML5-valid. Savannah ticket #13366. Thanks to Marco Bresciani
	for bringing this up.
	* Fixed a bug on the whitelist page (Tools -> LibreJS) where
	the "Reset whitelist to default" button wasn't working.

2014-11-10 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* LibreJS now works in private browsing mode, and with Tor.
	* The complaint email's default subject and body are now
	configurable.

2014-11-03 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Fix a bug where the complain button on the main LibreJS panel
	would never appear.

2014-10-26 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Fixed bug #43403 - LibreJS was marking all scripts as nonfree
	if the page returned a 404 status code. Thanks to Rubén
	Rodríguez for reporting this.

2014-10-25 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Fixed a bug where some sites would hang until you reload them.
	Savannah bug #43466

2014-10-24 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Fixed a bug where the complaint box would sometimes get
	mis-rendered.

2014-10-22 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Removed dependency to addon-tab library.

	* Updated node.js libraries for url_handler to node v0.10.33.

2014-10-20 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Disable JS analysis when JavaScript is turned off in the
	browser.

2014-08-28 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Updated Google Analytics regex, and added tests for this.

2014-08-23 Nik Nyby <nikolas@gnu.org>
	* Fixed a bug on pages with lots of embedded onclick= script
	attributes.

	* Fixed whitelisting table not loading any whitelisted scripts.

2012-11-25 Loic J. Duros <lduros@gnu.org>
	* Accepted scripts are displayed at the top of the main panel by
	default. This allows LibreJS to emphasize those scripts that are
	allowed, this list being usually shorter than those that are
	blocked.

	* The script list in the main panel is generated when clicking on
	the addon toolbar widget instead of at load time. This allows to
	display those scripts that are embedded dynamically after a
	certain amount of time (such as with setTimeout and with
	asynchronous function calls.)

	* A <th> element (table header) in the JS Web Labels table would
	throw an exception and prevent the JavaScript files from being
	flagged as free when applicable. (Thanks to Mark Burdett for
	reporting this issue.)

2012-11-14 Loic J. Duros <lduros@gnu.org>
	* Fixed issue with JS Web Labels when a Facebook iFrame was found
	in the JS Web Labels page. (It would prevent page from loading.)

2012-11-06 Loic J. Duros <lduros@gnu.org>
	* Fixed issue with missing third column in JS Web Labels reported
	by Mark Burdett. This bug would lead a page to never render if a
	column was missing from the JS Web Labels table.

	* Now ignoring the fragment part from the canonical URL of
	licenses. This issue was reported by Nicolas Cesar with the
	XFree86 URL.

	* More than one canonical URL can now be added to the license
	definitions, as it is now the case with the XFree86 license that
	links to both http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#3 and
	the new url http://www.xfree86.org/current/LICENSE4.html that is
	now commonly used.

	* Packaged with the Addon SDK version 1.11.

	* New and improved scripts for configure and make have been
	provided by Brandon Invergo.

2012-10-31 Loic J. Duros <lduros@gnu.org>
	* Fixed character encoding issues with koi8-r and many other
	  encoding problems.
	* Fixed issue with about:home and about:startpage, which was
	  crashing IceCat/Firefox when visiting the page while LibreJS was
	  enabled.
	* Now using DOMParser instead of the XUL hidden iframe.
	* Now using nsIDocumentEncoder instead of the innerHTML hack and
	  the DOMserializer.
	* Updated list of free JavaScript libraries from 275 versions to
	  306 versions.

2012-07-04 Loic J. Duros <lduros@gnu.org>
	* Bug fix with character encoding of certain pages.
	* Bug fix with <body> contents which were not parsed properly for
	certain pages (like article page on money.cnn.com)
	* Updated list of free libraries.

2012-06-04 Loic J. Duros <lduros@gnu.org>
	* Try catch clause for request module convert to unicode.
	  This should fix the gimp.org bug.

2012-05-24 Loic J. Duros lduros@gnu.org

	* Fixed a bug which would block an inline script detected as free
	under certain circumstances.

	* GNU LibreJS now detects 256 official versions of free libraries
	using their SHA1 hash, and accepts them as free.

	* Replaced the use of XHR (nsIXMLHttpRequest component) with a new
	module that creates a channel and listens for the data
	reception. This makes LibreJS compatible with Https-Everywhere,
	which ships with IceCat.

	* Now keeps in memory the list of JavaScript files that were
	listed in a JS Web Labels table. This enables adding scripts that
	are embedded dynamically to a JS Web Labels table.

	* Escaped a stylesheet variable in complaint feature (per AMO's
	request)
